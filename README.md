# Quantum Image Encryption

This is part of the work that I am doing for Practice School-1 internship at UST Global. This project aims to implement Quantum Image Encryption as specified in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8119911) (IEEE link). It uses NEQR, bit-planes, gray codes, and 2-D logistic sine map to achieve this.
